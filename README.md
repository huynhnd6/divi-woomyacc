## Usage

Copy this CSS ([custom.css](https://github.com/izzuddinfz/divi-woomyacc/blob/master/custom.css)) code to Custom CSS in Divi > Theme Option or copy this CSS ([custom.css](https://github.com/izzuddinfz/divi-woomyacc/blob/master/custom.css)) to your child theme CSS file.

If you didn't want to use the Divi button and form assets inside WooCommerce, use this CSS file ([custom-materialbtn.css](https://github.com/izzuddinfz/divi-woomyacc/blob/master/custom-materialbtn.css)) which is using button like Material.

If you need the function, copy ([functions.php](https://github.com/izzuddinfz/divi-woomyacc/blob/master/functions.php)) to functions.php.
